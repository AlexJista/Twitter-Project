# **Introduction to twitteR**

Twitter is a massive online social networking microblogging service that allows users to post short messages (“tweets”) that are 280 characters long. Across the years, this has been not only a unique form of social media, but also assists those users interested in data mining experiments. Within the twitteR package, users are provided access to the Twitter API within R, enabling them to subset certain Twitter data for analyses. This document introduces you to twitteR's fundamental tools used to analyze and draw data through Twitter's API. By installing the package, you will have access to all the twitteR functions to be ready to extract datasets from certain tweets, hashtags, and even user data. 

When extracting data from an online network's API you must:
  <li>Register for the online network's API</li>
  <li>Figure out what relevant information you need</li>
  <li>Use computer programming to describe how you want to analyze the datasets</li>
  <li>Execute the program</li>
<u1>
The twitteR package enables users to extract data through Twitter's API:
  <li>By creating functions to help you search for data</li>
  <li>By providing a simple set-up of registering for Twitter's API</li>
  <li>By converting datasets into RStudio to be more efficient if you choose to manipulate the data you're analyzing</li>

## Libraries 
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(httr)
library(twitteR)
library(openssl)
library(RSQLite)
```
#### **Setting Up Twitter OAuth with setup_twitter_oauth()**

setup_twitter_oauth() allows you to use a Twitter Developer account to access Twitter's API. To create a Twitter Developer account, one must apply at *https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access* and login with their Twitter credentials. From there, users must fill out an application to gain permission to access Twitter's API. After creating a Developer Twitter Account, go on the link *https://dev.twitter.com/apps* and click *Create New App* and fill out the necessary information. After granted permission to use Twitter's API, users will be able to access Twitter's API under their *Keys and tokens* tab. Users will be given a unique Consumer API Key, a unique Consumer Secret Key, a unique Access Token Key, and a unique Access Token Secret. Finally, within Twitter's API, you are able to seek through user data and load their tweets. 

```{r, results = 'hide'}
consumer_key <- "2GCWgA9HRyAFWHXw79n3kWDi7"
consumer_secret <- "yHLdijkMkY9GIzMXKE7kuyHWBdEIgSBcwPvm9q3eaDo2GLql9z"
access_token <- "1445559278-eLFn9SDtm8SCrkxY37WlC7wxZACx9Sjyfv0z8dc"
access_secret <- "2E4mbtdqYIAfy3BKPt7Wu8M4n5zil3rVTGdQL6QDbGasp"

setup_twitter_oauth(consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_secret)
```

#### **Searching Through Twitter's API with searchTwitter()**

searchTwitter() allows you to search through Twitter's API with different keywords. In terms of the arguments searchTwitter() takes, the first argument takes in a string with what you want to search with, this can be used to search up hashtags *#* or users *@*. The next argument "n" denotes how many tweets you want to search up for. "Since' is an argument that allows users to search tweets tweeted on a certain day in a YY-MM-DD format. The last argument "retryOnRateLimt" tries to search the content users searched for an x amount of times.

For example, we can search up the keyword *#coronavirus*, prompting 1,000 different tweets since January 1st, 2020.
```{r}
corona <- twitteR::searchTwitter('#coronavirus', n = 1e3, since = '2020-01-01', retryOnRateLimit = 1e2)
```

Another example can be used to search *@realDonaldTrump* during his Presidential Election in 2016.
```{r}
Trump <- twitteR::searchTwitter('@realDonaldTrump', n = 1e3, since = '2016-11-08', retryOnRateLimit = 1e2)
```


## **Timelines**
#### **User's Recent Tweets with userTimeline()**
userTimeline() allows users to retrieve a specific user's most recent tweets on Twitter. This function takes in a user object or a username as a string, and gets the last 20 (by default n = 20) tweets of a given user. It returns these tweets in the form of a list, sorted chronologically from latest to earliest.

For example, we can retrieve the five most recent tweets by Peanuts.
```{r}
userTimeline("PEANUTS", n = 5)
```

#### **User Home Tweets with homeTimeline()**
homeTimeline() allows users to retrieve their own specific tweets on their own homepage that they logged in via Twitter OAuth. This function gets the last 20 (by default n = 25) tweets of the homepage of the account registered in setup_twitter_oauth, and allows you to filter tweets by userID range. The tweets are returned in the form of a list, sorted from latest to earliest.

For example, we can retrieve the five most recent tweets by my own homepage (User: @Alex_Jista).
```{r}
homeTimeline(n = 5)
```

#### **User Mentions with mentions()**
mentions() allows users to retrieve their own specific mentions and what was tweeted to them. This function gets the last 25 (by default n = 25) recent mentions *@s* of the account registered in setup_twitter_oath, and allows users to filter tweets by userID range. The tweets are returned in the form of a list, sorted from latest to earliest.

For example, we can retrieve the 25 most recent mentions of me (User: @Alex_Jista).
```{r}
mentions(n = 25)
```

#### **User Retweets with retweetsOfMe()**
retweetsOfMe() allows users to retrieve their own specific retweets and what they retweeted. This function gets the last 25 (by default n = 25) retweets of the account registered in setup_twitter_oath’s tweets. The tweets are your tweets that were retweeted, sorted from latest to earliest.

Again, we will be using my username as an example (User: @Alex_Jista).
```{r}
retweetsOfMe(n = 25)
```

#### **Converting Data from Twitter to a Dataframe in R with twListToDF()**

twListToDF() allows users to convert the dataset extracted from Twitter to a dataframe in R. This is extremely helpful as users can now use the package *dplyr* to analyze the selected dataframe. The only argument twListToDF() takes is a dataset from Twitter to convert it.

For example, still using the coronavirus example, we were able to convert the dataset from Twitter into a dataframe in R.
```{r}
coronavirus <- twitteR::twListToDF(corona)
head(coronavirus$text)
```

Here is an example of the dataframe retrieved from searching Donald Trump's infamous Twitter.
```{r}
Donald_Trump <- twitteR::twListToDF(Trump)
head(Donald_Trump$text)
```

#### **Finding User IDs from Twitter to Search for Retweets and Users that Retweeted a Tweet with retweets()**

retweets() allows users to search for tweets on Twitter that were retweeted. Retweets takes in an argument of a tweet ID which searches up an exact tweet by a user and what they tweeted about. retweeters() is an additional function that also takes the argument of a tweet ID and returns the retweeter's ID number.

For example, user *@episod* posted about their expererience working at Twitter.
```{r}
episod <- retweets("21947795900469248", n = 6)
   st = showStatus("21947795900469248")
   retweeters(st$getId())
head(episod)
```

#### **Registering a Back-end Database Through Twitter with register_sql_backend()**

register_sqlite_backend() allows users to create or register for a back-end database for Twitter's API. A back-end database is a database that users can indirectly access to manipulate the data being analyzed. The function register_rsqlite_backend() takes in an argument of a SQLite file which can be found in your file directory upon downloading the required package of RSQLite. By registering a back-end database through SQLite, users are able to access data that is searched with the searchTwitter() function. In this case, *#coronavirus* is used again for this example. 
```{r}
register_sqlite_backend('database.sqlite')
   store_tweets_db(corona)
```

#### **Loading Tweets to Registered Back-end Database with load_tweets_db()**

load_tweets_db() allows users to load the tweets found from a user search with the prompoted function of searchTwitter() to load it into a data file in R. The function load_tweets_db() takes in a twitteR object, however if a user would rather import a dataframe, the user should call the function *"as.data.frame = TRUE"*. 
```{r}
corona_db <- load_tweets_db()
```

#### **Finding the Most Recent Tweeter's ID with get_latest_tweet_id()**

get_latest_tweet_id() allows users to find the most recent tweeter's ID based off of a SQLite database. The tweets are searched using the searchTwitter() function and later stored with the function store_tweets_db(). From there, Twitter's data is loaded from the database and into R and returns the latest tweet ID of the user who tweeted most recently of the searched tweet. 

For example, by using the coronavirus example again, we see the user ID of the most recent user that tweeted *#coronavirus*.
```{r}
get_latest_tweet_id(table_name = "tweets")
```

#### **Obtaining Twitter Supported Trending Locations with availableTrendLocations()**

availableTrendLocations() returns a table of supported trending locations (cities and their countries), along with their WOEID (Yahoo! Where On Earth IDs.)

As reference, here are the first five trending locations supported by Twitter.
```{r}
availableTrendLocations() %>% 
  head(5)
```

#### **Obtaining the Closest Supported Trending Location of Coordinates with closestTrendLocations()**

closestTrendLocations() uses latitude (South being negative, range from -180 to 180) and longitude (West being negative, range from -180 to 180) to return the closest available trending location to the given coordinates (along with it’s WOEID.)

This is the closest available trending location to San Luis Obispo.
```{r}
closestTrendLocations(35.2828, -120.6596)
```

#### **Get What's Trending for a WOEID using getTrends()**

getTrends() gets the trending tweets around a specific identification code (WOEID.) The table has the trending keywords/ phrases, and also includes the URL to the trending word/ phrase.

These are the top five current trending words/ phrases in Fresno.
```{r}
getTrends(2407517) %>% 
  head(5)
```

#### **Find a Specific User Account on Twitter with getUser()**

getUser() allows you to look up a user by username, and returns a user object. Note that capitolization matters.

For this example, we look up the user *PEANUTS*.
```{r}
getUser("PEANUTS")
```

#### **Get Multiple User Accounts on Twitter with lookupUsers()**

lookupUsers() allows you to look up multiple users with an input of a vector of username strings, and returns a list of user objects. Note that capitolization matters.

For this example, we look up users *PEANUTS* and *Woodstock*.
```{r}
lookupUsers(c("PEANUTS", "Woodstock"))
```

#### **Show Account Rate Limit Information Using getCurRateLimitInfo()**

getCurRateLimitInfo() returns the rate limit for the specific account registered in setup_twitter_oath in a table. This includes things such as showing Twitter users IDs, looking up users etc. This is used by Twitter to prevent spam/ overloading their servers.

Here are 5 example rate limits and their information.
```{r}
getCurRateLimitInfo() %>%
  head(5)
```

#### **Remove Retweets from a Status Object with strip_retweets()**

strip_retweets() takes in status object(s), and removes retweets by other users (only for commented ones, not for just hitting the button). Returns a list of only the original tweets.
```{r}
temp <- retweetsOfMe(n = 1)
strip_retweets(temp[1])
```

#### **Make a Tweet from R Using tweet()**

tweet() allows you to tweet using R with the account registered in setup_twitter_oath using an input string.

This makes @Alex_Jista tweet "I made this tweet from R!".
```{r}
tweet("I made this tweet from R!")
```
![example of a tweet made with R](images/tweet.jpg)

#### **Update Status on Twitter with updateStatus()**

updateStatus() is similar to tweet. It allows you to tweet using R, but also allows you to choose a location. Note that the location won't show up unless if you have "Add location information to my Tweets" enabled in Settings > Privacy and safety > Location information.

This makes @Alex_Jista tweet "Status updated." and the status will have a geotag of Uganda.
```{r}
updateStatus("Status updated.", lat = 1.3733, long = 32.2903)
```
![example of a tweet with a geotag made with R](images/geotweet.jpg)

#### **Delete a Status with deleteStatus()**

deleteStatus() deletes n tweets made previously in the account registered in setup_twitter_oath. Will return a boolean whether this function was able to delete the status(es) or not.

For this example *n* is 1.
```{r}
temp <- userTimeline("Alex_Jista", n = 1)
deleteStatus(temp[[1]])
```

#### **View a Status with showStatus()**

showStatus() shows the message of a tweet given it's ID.
```{r}
showStatus("1236911670896635904")
```

#### **See Multiple Statuses Using lookup_statuses()**

lookup_statuses() takes in a vector of IDs, and returns a list of status objects.
```{r}
lookup_statuses(c("1237369370621497345", "1234854299672489985"))
```
